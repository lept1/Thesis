Besides the baseline payoffs of the established strategic interaction, the following elements are also vital to determine the dynamic outcome of a game: the initial fitness of each agent and the rule of motion that describes how individuals switch between strategies. In addition to the dynamic rule commonly used in evolutionary games, the replicator dynamics, we propose another rule, which acknowledges the role of expectations and sophisticates the replicator mechanism.},

	abstract = {Classical replicator dynamics assumes that individuals play their games and adopt new strategies on a global level: Each player interacts with a representative sample of the population and if a strategy yields a payoff above the average, then it is expected to spread. In this article, we connect evolutionary models for infinite and finite populations: While the population itself is infinite, interactions and reproduction occurs in random groups of size N. Surprisingly, the resulting dynamics simplifies to the traditional replicator system with a slightly modified payoff matrix. The qualitative results, however, mirror the findings for finite populations, in which strategies are selected according to a probabilistic Moran process. In particular, we derive a one-third law that holds for any population size. In this way, we show that the deterministic replicator equation in an infinite population can be used to study the Moran process in a finite population and vice versa. We apply the results to three examples to shed light on the evolution of cooperation in the iterated prisoner{\rq}s dilemma, on risk aversion in coordination games and on the maintenance of dominated strategies.},

The bulk of this work has dealt with the successfulness and robustness of various strategies. Nowak and May (1992) considered an alternative approach to studying evolutionary games. They assumed that players were distributed across a two-dimensional (2D) lattice, interactions between players occurred locally, rather than at long range as in the well mixed situation. The resulting spatial evolutionary games display dynamics not seen in their well-mixed counterparts. An assumption underlying much of the work on spatial evolutionary games is that the state of all players is updated in unison or in synchrony. Using the framework outlined in Nowak and May (1992), we examine the effect of various asynchronous updating schemes on the dynamics of spatial evolutionary games. There are potential implications for the dynamics of a wide variety of spatially extended systems in biology, physics and chemistry.},

Because of its importance, it has been studied through computer experiments as well as in the laboratory and by analytical means. However, there are important differences between the way a system composed of many interacting elements is simulated by a digital machine and the manner in which it behaves when studied in real experiments. In some instances, these disparities can be marked enough so as to cast doubt on the implications of cellular automata type simulations for the study of cooperation in social systems. In particular, if such a simulation imposes space-time granularity, then its ability to describe the real world may be compromised. Indeed, we show that the results of digital simulations regarding territoriality and cooperation differ greatly when time is discrete as opposed to continuous.},

@article{langer_spatial_2008,
	abstract = {The evolutionary puzzle of cooperation describes situations where cooperators provide a fitness benefit to other individuals at some cost to themselves. Under Darwinian selection, the evolution of cooperation is a conundrum, whereas non-cooperation (or defection) is not. In the absence of supporting mechanisms, cooperators perform poorly and decrease in abundance. Evolutionary game theory provides a powerful mathematical framework to address the problem of cooperation using the prisoner{\rq}s dilemma. One well-studied possibility to maintain cooperation is to consider structured populations, where each individual interacts only with a limited subset of the population. This enables cooperators to form clusters such that they are more likely to interact with other cooperators instead of being exploited by defectors. Here we present a detailed analysis of how a few cooperators invade and expand in a world of defectors. If the invasion succeeds, the expansion process takes place in two stages: first, cooperators and defectors quickly establish a local equilibrium and then they uniformly expand in space. The second stage provides good estimates for the global equilibrium frequencies of cooperators and defectors. Under hospitable conditions, cooperators typically form a single, ever growing cluster interspersed with specks of defectors, whereas under more hostile conditions, cooperators form isolated, compact clusters that minimize exploitation by defectors. We provide the first quantitative assessment of the way cooperators arrange in space during invasion and find that the macroscopic properties and the emerging spatial patterns reveal information about the characteristics of the underlying microscopic interactions.},

@article{antonioni_random_2014,
	abstract = {This work presents a systematic study of population games of the Prisoner's Dilemma, Hawk--Dove, and Stag Hunt types in two-dimensional Euclidean space under two-person, one-shot game-theoretic interactions, and in the presence of agent random mobility. The goal is to investigate whether cooperation can evolve and be stable when agents can move randomly in continuous space. When the agents all have the same constant velocity cooperation may evolve if the agents update their strategies imitating the most successful neighbor. If a fitness difference proportional is used instead, cooperation does not improve with respect to the static random geometric graph case. When viscosity effects set-in and agent velocity becomes a quickly decreasing function of the number of neighbors they have, one observes the formation of monomorphic stable clusters of cooperators or defectors in the Prisoner's Dilemma. However, cooperation does not spread in the population as in the constant velocity case.},

@article{kucharik_optimally-stable_2006,
	abstract = {In one and two spatial dimensions, Lax--Wendroff schemes provide second-order accurate optimally-stable dispersive conservation-form approximations to non-linear conservation laws. These approximations are an important ingredient in sophisticated simulation algorithms for conservation laws whose solutions are discontinuous. Straightforward generalization of these Lax--Wendroff schemes to three dimensions produces an approximation that is unconditionally unstable. However, some dimensionally-split schemes do provide second-order accurate optimally-stable approximations in 3D (and 2D), and there are sub-optimally-stable non-split Lax--Wendroff-type schemes in 3D. The main result of this paper is the creation of new Lax--Wendroff-type second-order accurate optimally-stable dispersive non-split scheme that is in conservation form. The scheme is created by using linear equivalence to transform a symmetrized dimensionally-split scheme (based on a one-dimensional Lax--Wendroff scheme) to conservation form. We then create both composite and hybrid schemes by combining the new scheme with the diffusive first-order accurate Lax--Friedrichs scheme. Codes based on these schemes perform well on difficult fluid flow problems.},

When the game is played in two-dimensional continuous space, a reaction diffusion model produces highly irregular dynamics, in which cooperators and defectors survive in ever-changing configurations (Wakano et al., 2009. Spatial dynamics of ecological public goods. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 106, 7910--7914). The dynamics is related to the formation of Turing patterns, but the origin of the irregular dynamics is not well understood. In this paper, we present a classification of the spatio-temporal dynamics based on the dispersion relation, which reveals that the spontaneous pattern formation can be attributed to the dynamical interplay between two linearly unstable modes: temporal instability arising from a Hopfbifurcation and spatial instability arising from a Turing-bifurcation. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the highly irregular dynamics through Fourier analysis, the break-down of symmetry, the maximum Lyapunov exponent, and the excitability of the reaction-term dynamics. All results clearly support that the observed irregular dynamics qualifies as spatio-temporal chaos. A particularly interesting type of chaotic dynamics, which we call intermittent bursts, clearly demonstrates the effects of the two unstable modes where (local) periods of stasis alternate with rapid changes that may induce local extinction.},

This yields theoretical relations for the fundamental diagram and the equilibrium variance-density relation, but above all it allows the derivation of macroscopic traffic equations. These build a hierarchy of non-closed equations which can be closed by different zeroth-order approximations. In this way one obtains the traffic equations of Lighthill and Whitham or those of Phillips. Alternatively one can derive Euler-like traffic equations which are proposed here since they include additional dynamic equations for the velocity variance. The new variance equation is able to describe the empirically observed increase of variance directly before a traffic jam develops.},

As applications, we describe the phase diagrams of three systems when the parameters are close to the voter model: (i) a stochastic spatial Lotka-Volterra model of Neuhauser and Pacala, (ii) a model of the evolution of cooperation of Ohtsuki, Hauert, Lieberman, and Nowak, and (iii) a continuous time version of the non-linear voter model of Molofsky, Durrett, Dushoff, Griffeath, and Levin. The first application confirms a conjecture of Cox and Perkins [8] and the second confirms a conjecture of Ohtsuki et al [38] in the context of certain infinite graphs. An important feature of our general results is that they do not require the process to be attractive.},

In 1D we observe modified travelling wave solutions in the presence of diffusion, and asymptotic attracting states under a frozen strategy assumption without diffusion. In 2D we observe spiral formation and breakup in the frozen strategy rock-paper-scissors game without diffusion.

The main objective of this paper is to study a stochastic spatial version of this game based on the framework of interacting particle systems in which players are located on an infinite square lattice. In the presence of two strategies, and calling a strategy selfish or altruistic depending on a certain ordering of the coefficients of the underlying payoff matrix, a simple analysis of the nonspatial mean-field approximation of the spatial model shows that a strategy is evolutionary stable if and only if it is selfish, making the system bistable when both strategies are selfish. The spatial and nonspatial models agree when at least one strategy is altruistic. In contrast, we prove that, in the presence of two selfish strategies and in any spatial dimensions, only the most selfish strategy remains evolutionary stable. The main ingredients of the proof are monotonicity results and a coupling between the best-response dynamics properly rescaled in space with bootstrap percolation to compare the infinite time limits of both systems.},

These determine the color genealogy by means of reduced graphs. We focus our attention on models where the voter and boundary nucleation dynamics depend only on the colors of nearest neighbor sites, for which convergence of the discrete net with killing to its continuum analog was proved in an earlier paper by the authors. We use some detailed properties of the Brownian net with killing to prove voter model perturbations convergence to its continuum counterpart. A crucial property of reduced graphs is that even in the continuum, they are finite almost surely.

In real-world social dilemmas these choices are temporally extended. Cooperativeness is a property that applies to policies, not elementary actions. We introduce sequential social dilemmas that share the mixed incentive structure of matrix game social dilemmas but also require agents to learn policies that implement their strategic intentions. We analyze the dynamics of policies learned by multiple self-interested independent learning agents, each using its own deep Qnetwork, on two Markov games we introduce here: 1. a fruit Gathering game and 2. a Wolfpack hunting game. We characterize how learned behavior in each domain changes as a function of environmental factors including resource abundance. Our experiments show how conflict can emerge from competition over shared resources and shed light on how the sequential nature of real world social dilemmas affects cooperation.},

In real-world prisoner{\rq}s dilemmas, these choices are temporally extended and different strategies may correspond to sequences of actions, reflecting grades of cooperation. We introduce a Sequential Prisoner{\rq}s Dilemma (SPD) game to better capture the aforementioned characteristics. In this work, we propose a deep multiagent reinforcement learning approach that investigates the evolution of mutual cooperation in SPD games. Our approach consists of two phases. The first phase is offline: it synthesizes policies with different cooperation degrees and then trains a cooperation degree detection network. The second phase is online: an agent adaptively selects its policy based on the detected degree of opponent cooperation. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in two representative SPD 2D games: the ApplePear game and the Fruit Gathering game. Experimental results show that our strategy can avoid being exploited by exploitative opponents and achieve cooperation with cooperative opponents.},

The social field reflects public opinion, social norms and trends. It is not only given by external factors (the environment) but also by the interactions of individuals.

	abstract = {The movement of pedestrians is supposed to show certain regularities which can be best described by an ``algorithm'' for the individual behavior and is easily simulated on computers. This behavior is assumed to be determined by an intended velocity, by several attractive and repulsive effects and by fluctuations. The movement of pedestrians is dependent on decisions, which have the purpose of optimizing their behavior and can be explicitly modelled. Some interesting applications of the model to real situations are given, especially to formation of groups, behavior in queues, avoidance of collisions and selection processes between behavioral alternatives.},

@article{helbing_stochastic_1993,
	abstract = {In the last decade, stochastic models have shown to be very useful for quantitative modelling of social processes. Here, a configurational master equation for the description of behavioral changes by pair interactions of individuals is developed. Three kinds of social pair interactions are distinguished: Avoidance processes, compromising processes, and imitative processes. Computational results are presented for a special case of imitative processes: the competition of two equivalent strategies. They show a phase transition that describes the selforganization of a behavioral convention. This phase transition is further analyzed by examining the equations for the most probable behavioral distribution, which are Boltzmann-like equations. Special cases of Boltzmann-like equations do not obey the H-theorem and have oscillatory or even chaotic solutions. A suitable Taylor approximation leads to the socalled game dynamical equations (also known as selection-mutation equations in the theory of evolution).},

@article{hauert_effects_2002,
	abstract = {A systematic analysis of the effects of spatial extension on the equilibrium frequency of cooperators and defectors in 2 Ã— 2 games is presented and compared to well mixed populations where spatial extension can be neglected. We demonstrate that often spatial extension is indeed capable of promoting cooperative behavior. This holds in particular for the prisoner's dilemma for a small but important parameter range. For the hawk--dove game, spatial extension may lead to both, increases of the hawk- as well as the dove-strategy. The outcome subtly depends on the parameters as well as on the degree of stochasticity in the different update rules. For rectangular lattices, the general conclusions are rather robust and hold for different neighborhood types i.e. for the von Neumann as well as the Moore neighborhood and, in addition, they appear to be almost independent of the update rule of the lattice. However, increasing stochasticity for the update rules of the players results in equilibrium frequencies more closely related to the mean field description.},

@article{durrett_spatial_2014,
	abstract = {Here we will use results of Cox, Durrett, and Perkins [56] for voter model perturbations to study spatial evolutionary games on Zd, d â‰¥ 3 when the interaction kernel is finite range, symmetric, and has covariance matrix Ïƒ2I. The games we consider have payoff matrices of the form 1 + wG where 1 is matrix of all 1{\rq}s and w is small and positive. Since our population size N = \ensuremath{\infty}, we call our selection small rather than weak which usually means w = O(1/N ). The key to studying these games is the fact that when the dynamics are suitably rescaled in space and time they convergence to solutions of a reaction diffusion equation (RDE). Inspired by work of Ohtsuki and Nowak [28] and Tarnita et al [35, 36] we show that the reaction term is the replicator equation for a modified game matrix and the modifications of the game matrix depend on the interaction kernel only through the values of two or three simple probabilities for an associated coalescing random walk.},

@article{kimmel_time_2019,
	abstract = {The co-evolutionary dynamics of competing populations can be strongly affected by frequency-dependent selection and spatial population structure. As co-evolving populations grow into a spatial domain, their initial spatial arrangement and their growth rate differences are important factors that determine the long-term outcome. We here model producer and free-rider co-evolution in the context of a diffusive public good (PG) that is produced by the producers at a cost but evokes local concentration-dependent growth benefits to all. The benefit of the PG can be non-linearly dependent on public good concentration. We consider the spatial growth dynamics of producers and free-riders in one, two and three dimensions by modeling producer cell, free-rider cell and public good densities in space, driven by the processes of birth, death and diffusion (cell movement and public good distribution). Typically, one population goes extinct, but the time-scale of this process varies with initial conditions and the growth rate functions. We establish that spatial variation is transient regardless of dimensionality, and that structured initial conditions lead to increasing times to get close to an extinction state, called Îµ-extinction time. Further, we find that uncorrelated initial spatial structures do not influence this Îµ-extinction time in comparison to a corresponding well-mixed (non-spatial) system. In order to estimate the Îµ-extinction time of either free-riders or producers we derive a slow manifold solution. For invading populations, i.e. for populations that are initially highly segregated, we observe a traveling wave, whose speed can be calculated. Our results provide quantitative predictions for the transient spatial dynamics of cooperative traits under pressure of extinction.},

@article{choi_analytical_2016,
	abstract = {The theory of Fourier heat conduction predicts accurately the temperature profiles of a system in a non-equilibrium steady state. However, in the case of transient states at the nanoscale, its applicability is significantly limited. The limitation of the classical Fourier{\rq}s theory was overcome by C. Cattaneo and P. Vernotte who developed the theory of non-Fourier heat conduction in 1958. Although this new theory has been used in various thermal science areas, it requires considerable mathematical skills for calculating analytical solutions. The aim of this study was the identification of a newer and a simpler type of solution for the hyperbolic partial differential equations of the non-Fourier heat conduction. This constitutes the first trial in a series of planned studies. By inspecting each term included in the proposed solution, the theoretical feasibility of the solution was achieved. The new analytical solution for the non-Fourier heat conduction is a simple exponential function that is compared to the existing data for justification. Although the proposed solution partially satisfies the Cattaneo--Vernotte equation, it cannot simulate a thermal wave behavior. However, the results of this study indicate that it is possible to obtain the theoretical solution of the Cattaneo--Vernotte equation by improving the form of the proposed solution.},

Necessary as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for monotonicity of explicit schemes are also developed. The notion of submonotone difference schemes is considered and the associated criteria are developed. We discuss the interrelationship between monotonicity, submonotonicity, and stability.

@article{foster_stochastic_1990,
	abstract = {The concept of an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) is a useful tool for studying the dynamics of natural selection. One of its limitations, however, is that it does not capture the notion of long-run stability when the system is subjected to stochastic effects. We define the concept of stability in a stochastic dynamical system, and show that it differs from both the traditional ESS and the concept of an attractor in a dynamical system. The stochastically stable set may be computed analytically using recent advances in potential theory.},
