\section*{Abstract}

Since 1950, the Prisoner's Dilemma was used as an ideal model to study
the cooperative behaviour in social and biological systems. The aim
of this work is to study and compare discrete-agents and continuous
models for the spatial evolutionary game. First, we analyze and solve
numerically the known PDE models for the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma:
the reaction-diffusion equation of Vickers (1989) and then the hyperbolic
model proposed by Amadori, Boccabella e Natalini (2010). We discuss
the relations between the solutions of these PDEs and discrete models
of random walkers on a square lattice evolving according to the replicator
equation. We finally study the model of Durrett (2014), who showed
that spatial games on lattices can be written as a perturbed voter
model and that they converge to the solutions of a reaction-diffusion
replicator equation of a modified game. Following this approach, after
simulating a perturbed voter model on a simple lattice we propose
a reaction-diffusion equation in two spatial dimensions for a modified
game and solve it numerically.\selectlanguage{british}%
